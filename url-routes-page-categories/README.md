# Dynamic Route Creation in React

<b>Problem Statement</b>
The objective was to enhance the user experience, scalability, SEO, and content management by implementing a robust URL routing system and dynamic page categories.
After consistent feedback from users about difficulties in finding particular content topics, this solution was devised to improve the user experience by enhancing content categorization and simplifying content management for CMS administrators.

<b>Technologies Used</b>
React, Gatsby, GraphQL, Firestore

<b>Implementation Details</b>

A core part of the solution involved React Router, a popular library that enables declarative routing in React applications. React Router allowed me to define and manage routes within our application, ensuring that specific components were rendered when certain URLs were accessed. Here's how I approached dynamic route creation for our specific content categories:

*Route Configuration*

I established a route configuration system that mapped content categories to specific React components. This configuration acted as a blueprint for defining how different categories of content would be displayed. React Router's Route component was used to match URLs to the appropriate component based on the route configuration.

*Dynamic Routes*

To create dynamic routes, I dynamically generated route definitions based on the available content categories. This allowed me to scale the routing system as new categories were added.

*GraphQL Integration*

GraphQL played a crucial role in this process by providing the necessary data to populate content pages for insurance offerings, treatment services, and therapies offered by medical facilities. When a user accessed a particular URL, GraphQL queries were executed to fetch the relevant content for that category. This seamless integration ensured that the content remained up-to-date and accurate.

<b>Benefits and Achievements</b>

- 30% increase in organic traffic with the introduction of insurance pages, speaking to a primary user need
- 15% increase in conversion rates, resulting from insurance being a key point in influencing a user to make an inquiry
- Reduced customer support queries regarding insurance offerings by 10%

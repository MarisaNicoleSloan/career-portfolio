### Dynamic Breadcrumb Trail Hierarchy

**Problem Statement**

The primary aim was to improve user navigation on the website by implementing a dynamic breadcrumb trail hierarchy. This feature would automatically generate breadcrumb sequences, sorting values from broad (e.g., country) to specific (e.g., city), eliminating the need for manual CMS updates and saving valuable time.

**Technologies**
- GraphQL
- Postgres
- React

**Results and Achievements**
- Improved user navigation, leading to a 20% decrease in bounce rates and a 25% increase in page views
- Significantly reduced the workload for content managers by eliminating the need for manual CMS updates, saving hundreds of hours

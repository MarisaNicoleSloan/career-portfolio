## The Business Challenge: Hindering Patient Access and Operational Strain

The existing healthcare resource hub faced significant challenges stemming from its outdated architecture and manual content management processes. These issues directly impacted both patient experience and internal efficiency:

### Key Issues:

- **Poor Content Discoverability and Inconsistent Routing**: Patients struggled to find specific information due to a disorganized structure and unpredictable URLs, potentially delaying access to crucial details about their health and treatment options.
- **Manual Workflows for Content Management**: Managing over 10,000 pages manually led to inconsistencies, errors, and a significant drain on administrative resources.
- **Lack of Visibility in Search Results**: Inefficient metadata and a lack of structured data prevented the site from appearing prominently in search results (e.g., rich snippets), limiting organic patient reach.
- **Suboptimal User Flow**: Cluttered navigation and an inefficient content structure resulted in high bounce rates and lower engagement, indicating that patients were not finding the information they needed quickly and easily.
- **Scalability Limitations**: The monolithic architecture made it difficult to add new content and features efficiently, hindering the organization's ability to adapt to evolving healthcare needs.

## User Research & Insights: Understanding Patient Needs and Search Behavior

User testing and data analytics revealed critical friction points in the existing site:

- **Overwhelmed Users**: Patients expressed confusion when navigating the vast array of treatment options, clinics, and insurance providers, highlighting the need for clearer organization.
- **Frustration with Navigation**: Key user feedback indicated that unclear category labels and a lack of effective filtering options made it difficult to narrow down relevant information.
- **SEO Opportunities**: Keyword and competitor analysis identified significant opportunities to improve organic visibility by leveraging rich snippets and structured data for healthcare-related searches. This could directly improve patient access to reliable information.

- Integrated pagination, deep linking, and robust query-based filtering powered by route-aware GraphQL queries, allowing users to efficiently navigate and refine search results.

---

### CMS & Data Architecture: Flexible Content Management

- **Sanity CMS**: Leveraged Sanity as a headless CMS for product and service pages, providing a flexible content model that could adapt to the evolving nature of medical information. Extended Sanity with custom fields and implemented content synchronization with PostgreSQL for relational querying and maintaining historical data, potentially aiding in compliance and audit trails.
- **WordPress CMS**: Integrated the existing WordPress instance as a headless CMS for legacy content, extending it with custom fields and synchronizing data with PostgreSQL to ensure data consistency and enable relational querying across all content sources.
- **Firestore**: Implemented Firestore for real-time administrative workflows, empowering non-technical editors to make immediate content updates without requiring code deployments, significantly improving agility.
- **Custom WordPress Plugins**: Developed bespoke WordPress plugins to streamline editorial workflows and manage structured metadata effectively, ensuring content accuracy and consistency.

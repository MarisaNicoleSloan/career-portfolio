Concurrently, a dynamic treatment information module enhanced user understanding of treatment options, leading to increased engagement and confidence platform-wide. These strategic improvements optimized both internal processes and the user experience, resulting in enhanced efficiency, user empowerment, and positive platform metrics.

## Business Challenge

The digital healthcare platform faced two key challenges that hindered both internal efficiency and the user experience:

1.  **Inefficient Content Management:** Maintaining accurate and up-to-date information, particularly default FAQs across a vast number of center pages, was a time-consuming and error-prone process. Custom FAQs often overrode default content, leading to inconsistencies and increased administrative burden.
    * **Internal Pain Points:**
        * **Customization Needs:** Centers needed an easier way to edit default FAQs rather than creating custom FAQs for every minor change.
        * **Data Maintenance:** Custom FAQs were overriding default FAQs in Sanity, leading to maintenance challenges and outdated information. Changes in variables (e.g., price, insurance) required manual updates, which were prone to errors and delays.
    * **Customer Feedback:**
        * Centers with standardized operations expressed frustration with manual updates.
        * Admins sought simpler solutions to adjust FAQ text without needing to rebuild entire FAQs.
        * Clients noted that small tweaks to information should not require rebuilding FAQs from scratch.
        * *"Our team was spending hours each week just updating basic information across different pages. It felt like we were constantly playing catch-up."* - Administrator at a multi-location rehab network

2.  **Lack of Clarity in Treatment Information:** Many individuals seeking information about addiction and mental health facilities struggled to understand the different levels of care available, hindering their ability to make informed decisions about treatment options. The platform lacked a clear and accessible presentation of the continuum of care.

3.  **Poor Content Discoverability and Inconsistent Routing**: Patients struggled to find specific information due to a disorganized structure and unpredictable URLs, potentially delaying access to crucial details about their health and treatment options.

    * **User Research Results:**
        * In interviews with 50 users, 80% expressed frustration with not knowing the difference between outpatient and inpatient care.
        * 45% of survey respondents indicated that unclear treatment options were a significant barrier to making informed decisions about care.
        * 30% of users reported they would have engaged with treatment centers sooner if the treatment levels were better explained.

## Core Capabilities Implemented

To address these interconnected challenges, the following core capabilities were designed and implemented:

### 1. Automated & Centralized FAQ Management

**Goal:** To streamline the management of default FAQs, ensure accuracy, and reduce administrative workload.

**Data Flow for Core Content Updates:**

* **User interface and content management**: Sanity provides the interface for content managers. CMS is a restrictive interface to update data.
* **Digital asset management**: Cloudinary is an image hosting provider for content content. All image content updates are synced to Cloudinary and the Algolia collection for the entry.
* **Data source**: PostgreSQL database stores the core content. Algolia is a search engine specifically used for searching core content (center and location data). Sanity is an interface for managing content that is then automatically synced (replicated) in PostgreSQL and Algolia.
* **Data retrieval**: GraphQL API queries only the necessary data. It bridges between Postgres and WordPress. More developer-friendly way to write queries for data retrieval.
* **Front-end**: CMS updates reflect on front end following site build
* **CDN**: User traffic is routed through cloudflare, which caches static assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts, 3rd-party libraries)
* **End user**: Sees the most recent data updates in the UI

**Functionality:**

* **Dynamic Default FAQ Population:** Developed a Node.js backend API to fetch default FAQ data from PostgreSQL. The API ensured that FAQs were correctly mapped to center-specific configurations. Implemented a React component to dynamically render FAQs in Sanity. This component displayed the default FAQs with options for editing, allowing Sanity to automatically populate with up-to-date FAQs based on the centerâ€™s configuration. Utilized GraphQL to efficiently query only the necessary FAQ data, reducing unnecessary data load and optimizing performance.

* **Automatic Updates for Variable Data:** Designed and configured AWS Lambda functions to listen for changes in PostgreSQL-stored center data (e.g., pricing or insurance), automatically triggering updates to the relevant FAQ fields in Sanity. Used GraphQL queries to fetch only the updated FAQ data, ensuring accurate, real-time reflections of center-specific changes with minimal manual intervention.
* **Intuitive In-CMS Editing:** Built a user-friendly interface using Tailwind CSS for Sanity. This allowed admins to modify FAQ text directly within the default FAQ framework, eliminating the need to create custom FAQs for every minor change. Focused on providing a responsive UI that worked seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices, ensuring the process of FAQ management was smooth and efficient for admins on all devices.


### SEO & Structured Data: Improving Visibility and Trust

- Generated clean and descriptive URLs for all dynamic pages, improving search engine understanding and user comprehension.
- Implemented comprehensive meta tags, Open Graph tags, and automated JSON-LD schema for various content types, including:
    - Articles
    - Medical Clinics
    - Insurance Providers
    - FAQs
    - Reviews
    - Breadcrumbs
- Validated all structured data using Google Rich Results Test and Search Console, ensuring accurate representation in search results and enhancing trust.
- Automated schema injection at build time via Gatsby, ensuring consistent and accurate structured data across thousands of pages without manual intervention. This improves the likelihood of patients finding reliable health information through search engines.

### Performance Optimization: Delivering Fast and Reliable Access

- Refactored data queries and optimized asset loading to achieve a Time to Interactive (TTI) of under 2 seconds, ensuring rapid access to critical health information for patients.
- Implemented Cloudflare CDN for efficient content caching and lazy loading of assets, minimizing page load times and improving the overall user experience, especially on slower connections.
- Structured GraphQL queries on a per-route basis to prevent over-fetching of data and reduce build times, contributing to a faster and more efficient website.



**Technical Challenges Overcome:**

* **Data Synchronization:** Implemented a robust error handling system to ensure that failed updates would retry automatically, preventing data inconsistencies between PostgreSQL and Sanity.
* **Performance Optimization:** Initial GraphQL queries were causing performance bottlenecks. Optimized queries by implementing pagination and selective field fetching, reducing average response time from 3s to 200ms.
* **Editing Workflow:** Created a custom React component for Sanity that preserved core FAQ content while allowing variable sections to be edited, solving the challenge of balancing standardization with customization.

**Testing and Quality Assurance:**

* Developed unit tests using Jest to ensure the integrity of the FAQ population and editing features. Tests were designed to validate that default FAQs were correctly populated in Sanity and that edits were saved without errors.
* Ran Cypress integration tests to simulate real-world scenarios and ensure that changes to center configurations (such as pricing or insurance) properly triggered updates to FAQs, ensuring end-to-end functionality across the system.
* - Integrated automated schema validation, code linting, and the execution of all tests into GitHub Actions and Netlify deploy previews, ensuring continuous quality assurance throughout the development lifecycle.
* - Implemented WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout the interface, ensuring accessibility for users with disabilities.

### 2. Dynamic Treatment Education Module

**Goal:** To enhance user understanding of available treatment options and facilitate informed decision-making.

**UX Design Process:**

Led the iterative design process, including user research, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing. UX designers created detailed mockups and explored multiple state changes (hover, focus, active, etc.) in Figma, leveraging a comprehensive design library to ensure consistency and adherence to brand guidelines. These Figma designs served as the blueprint for the user interface of the treatment education module. The final module was placed beneath the center overview panel to ensure visibility without overwhelming the user. The design team initially suggested a grid approach, but this was later revised in favor of a more linear presentation to prioritize clarity based on user feedback and technical considerations. I then took these Figma designs and converted them into the final, responsive UI implementation using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless transition from design to code.

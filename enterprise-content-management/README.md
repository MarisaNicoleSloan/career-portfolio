## The Business Challenge: Hindering Patient Access and Operational Strain

The existing healthcare resource hub faced significant challenges stemming from its outdated architecture and manual content management processes. These issues directly impacted both patient experience and internal efficiency:

### Key Issues:

- **Poor Content Discoverability and Inconsistent Routing**: Patients struggled to find specific information due to a disorganized structure and unpredictable URLs, potentially delaying access to crucial details about their health and treatment options.
- **Manual Workflows for Content Management**: Managing over 10,000 pages manually led to inconsistencies, errors, and a significant drain on administrative resources, with content updates taking an average of 3-5 business days.
- **Lack of Visibility in Search Results**: Inefficient metadata and a lack of structured data prevented the site from appearing prominently in search results (e.g., rich snippets), limiting organic patient reach by an estimated 30%.
- **Suboptimal User Flow**: Cluttered navigation and an inefficient content structure resulted in high bounce rates (58%) and lower engagement, indicating that patients were not finding the information they needed quickly and easily.
- **Healthcare Compliance Challenges**: The existing system made it difficult to maintain consistent PHI (Protected Health Information) handling and update healthcare disclaimers across thousands of pages.
- **Scalability Limitations**: The monolithic architecture made it difficult to add new content and features efficiently, hindering the organization's ability to adapt to evolving healthcare needs.

## User Research & Insights: Understanding Patient Needs and Search Behavior

User testing and data analytics revealed critical friction points in the existing site:

- **Overwhelmed Users**: Patients expressed confusion when navigating the vast array of treatment options, clinics, and insurance providers, highlighting the need for clearer organization.
- **Frustration with Navigation**: Key user feedback indicated that unclear category labels and a lack of effective filtering options made it difficult to narrow down relevant information.
- **Health Literacy Challenges**: Research revealed that users with varying health literacy levels struggled differently with medical terminology, suggesting a need for layered information presentation.
- **SEO Opportunities**: Keyword and competitor analysis identified significant opportunities to improve organic visibility by leveraging rich snippets and structured data for healthcare-related searches. This could directly improve patient access to reliable information.

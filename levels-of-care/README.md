# Levels of Care Feature for Mental Health and Addiction Treatment

<b>Problem Statement</b>

Many individuals seeking information about addiction and mental health facilities often struggle to find clear and comprehensive information about the available support tiers, which can range from outpatient therapy to intensive inpatient options. The existing system lacked clarity in presenting these support tiers, making it difficult for users to make informed decisions about their treatment.

<b>User Research Results</b>

The project began with extensive user research, including surveys and user interviews. The findings revealed that users faced challenges in understanding the different levels of care available for mental health and addiction treatment. They expressed a need for clear and accessible information to make informed decisions about their treatment options.

<b>Implementation Details</b>

In order to address the issues mentioned above, I implemented the following key technical features:

<b>Database Integration</b>

I leveraged PostgreSQL, a relational database, to store and manage information about addiction and mental health facilities. This database included details about specializations, treatment options, and support tiers. This structured approach allowed us to provide users with comprehensive and up-to-date information. GraphQL queries were configured to efficiently retrieve data from the database and present it in an organized manner.

<b>React-Based User Interface</b>

Built a dynamic and user-friendly interface using ReactJS to display information about these facilities. This allowed users to easily navigate and explore the treatment options available to them. The user interface was designed to be intuitive and accessible, catering to a diverse user base.

<b>Conditional Hyperlinks</b>

To further enhance the user experience, I implemented a feature that conditionally displayed hyperlinks to related pages based on user preferences and the availability of relevant results. This optimization ensured that users were directed to pages with ample results, enhancing their overall experience and minimizing frustration. 

<b>Benefits and Achievements</b>

- 50% Increase in Page Views: Within just two weeks of launching the feature, I observed a remarkable 50% increase in page views. This demonstrated that the enhancements were effective in engaging users and providing them with the information they needed.

- Enhanced Reputation: The platform has gained recognition as a reliable and valuable source of information for addiction and mental health facilities. Users now trust the platform to provide clear and comprehensive data, reinforcing the website's reputation as a go-to resource in this critical domain.

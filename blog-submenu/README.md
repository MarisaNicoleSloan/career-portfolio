## Tech Stack 
- Frontend: ReactJS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Gatsby, Webpack
- Routing & Pages: React Router, Gatsby‚Äôs createPages API
- Backend: WordPress, Postgres, GraphQL, Firestore
- State Management: Local, derived, and synced state via Redux
- Testing & Optimization: Jest, Cypress
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Netlify, Vercel
- Version Control: Git, GitHub

## Business Challenge  
The existing site struggled with poor content organization, duplicate URLs, and inefficient metadata‚Äîhindering SEO, user navigation, and scalability. Manual management of 10,000+ pages led to content drift and a fragmented user experience.

### Key issues:
 - Poor content discoverability and inconsistent routing
 - Manual workflows for content management
 - Lack of visibility in search results (e.g., rich snippets, featured content)
 - Suboptimal user flow, leading to higher bounce rates and lower conversions
 - Cluttered navigation and inefficient content structure across 10,000+ pages
---

## User Research & Insights  
User testing and data analytics surfaced major friction points:

 - Users were overwhelmed navigating treatment options, clinics, and insurance providers
 - Key user feedback highlighted frustration with unclear category labels and a lack of filtering options.
 - Category labels were unclear, and filter options were limited
 - Keyword and competitor analysis revealed SEO opportunities using rich snippets and structured data

## Dynamic Routing System and Page Generation

- Route Configuration: Used React Router to create a system for mapping content categories (e.g., /insurance/aetna/) to specific React components. This allowed for dynamic page generation based on category-specific data fetched from GraphQL.
- Dynamic Pages: Designed dynamic routes using Gatsby‚Äôs Page Query to ensure that the content for each page was pulled directly from a data source (Firestore/GraphQL). As new service pages were added, the route system would automatically handle them, keeping the site scalable.
- GraphQL API: Integrated GraphQL queries to ensure that every route was dynamically populated with the latest information, such as insurance plan details or treatment therapies. This enabled better content synchronization and accuracy across the website.

### SEO Enhancements
- Unique, Descriptive URLs: Worked on SEO-friendly URL structure (e.g., /insurance/aetna/) to make each page more easily discoverable by search engines and users.
- Meta Tags & Structured Data: Added meta tags, OG tags, and structured data to ensure that each page had optimized content for search engines, social media platforms, and third-party applications.
- Content Management System Enhancements

### Firestore Integration
Integrated Firestore as the backend database to store content for each category. This allowed real-time updates and easy content management without requiring heavy backend logic or manual updates, enabling non-technical administrators to manage content more efficiently.

### PostgreSQL for Data Storage
Used PostgreSQL to store historical data and ensure consistency across dynamic routes, allowing for more sophisticated querying and content aggregation.

## User Experience Enhancements

UI/UX Design: Leveraged Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive, user-friendly interface, enhancing readability and mobile accessibility for healthcare-related content.

Navigation Optimization: Created intuitive breadcrumb navigation and category-based menus, allowing users to easily filter through insurance providers, treatment options, and other services.

Feedback Integration: Incorporated user feedback from both patients and site administrators to continually improve the flow of information and make the site easier to navigate.

Dynamic Routing and Page Generation
- Built a scalable routing architecture using React Router + Gatsby to generate page dynamically on the server (e.g. /insurance/aetna/) that pulled structured data from GraphQL + Firestore.
- Created templates for services, clinics, and FAQs that automatically generated new pages based on backend content updates‚Äîenabling content at scale with low engineering overhead.
- Integrated PostgreSQL for structured historical data storage and advanced content filtering.

Structured Data & SEO Enhancements
Developed JSON-LD schemas for:

 - Articles
 - Medical Clinics
 - Insurance Providers
 - FAQs
 - Reviews
 - Breadcrumbs

Implemented schema types per Schema.org standards and validated them using Google Rich Results Test and Search Console.
Automated schema generation during Gatsby builds, ensuring all new pages included accurate structured metadata.

## Quality Assurance Testing and Optimization
Ran rigorous validation using schema testing tools, Google Search Console, and in-browser previews.
Incorporated automated linting and schema validation checks into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous quality assurance.


## User Feedback
Patients: Found the improved structure and dynamic pages easier to navigate, leading to faster access to relevant insurance details and treatment options during the evaluation stage of their journey.

Administrators: Benefited from an optimized content management process, with fewer manual updates required and a more streamlined workflow for managing content at scale.

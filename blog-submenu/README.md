## Business Challenge  
The existing site lacked clear content organization and routing, hindering user navigation. SEO performance was also impacted by duplicate URLs and inefficient metadata, affecting organic traffic. The challenge was to implement a scalable content structure and improve search engine rankings.

### Key issues:
 - Poor content discoverability and inconsistent routing
 - Manual management of 10,000+ pages, limiting scalability and increasing the risk of content drift
 - Lack of visibility in search results (e.g., rich snippets, featured content)
 - Suboptimal user flow, leading to higher bounce rates and lower conversions
 - Cluttered navigation and inefficient content structure across 10,000+ pages
---

## User Research & Insights  
User testing and data analytics indicated key pain points:

 - Users found it difficult to navigate the massive catalog of treatment options, insurance plans, and clinics.
 - Key user feedback highlighted frustration with unclear category labels and a lack of filtering options.
 - Search results were inconsistent, with important content buried deep within the site.
 - Through keyword analysis and competitive benchmarking, we identified opportunities to improve on-page SEO by incorporating schema for rich snippets and focusing on better taxonomies for healthcare topics.

## Technical Execution

### Content Organization & Navigation  
- Built a **dynamic hierarchical category system** using GraphQL to reduce content overload.
- Designed a **submenu UI** for quick access to relevant topics.
- Designed a **hierarchical taxonomy** for content categories, then mapped that to Gatsby’s page generation system.  
- Built **category landing pages** and **individual article pages** dynamically using `gatsby-node.js`.

### Routing & State  
- Used **React Router** for custom client-side routing and deep linking across categories.  
- Handled submenu navigation state locally, while syncing global content filters via GraphQL.  
- Managed UI state (expanded menus, selected filters) in a scalable, reusable pattern.
  
### Performance & Scalability  
- Refactored data layer using **Postgres** for relational efficiency.
- Used **GraphQL** to fetch only the data needed, improving speed and responsiveness.
- Structured GraphQL queries to fetch content by category and author.  
- Used **Cloudflare caching and lazy loading** to keep load times under 2s, even for large datasets.  
- Enabled pagination for long category archives to reduce client load.

### Seamless CMS Integration  
- Developed custom WordPress plugins for syncing with Postgres.
- Preserved editorial workflows while modernizing the content delivery stack.

## Dynamic Routing System and Page Generation

Route Configuration: Using React Router, I created a system for mapping content categories (e.g., /insurance/aetna/) to specific React components. This allowed for dynamic page generation based on category-specific data fetched from GraphQL.
Dynamic Pages: Designed dynamic routes using Gatsby’s Page Query to ensure that the content for each page was pulled directly from a data source (Firestore/GraphQL). As new service pages were added, the route system would automatically handle them, keeping the site scalable.
GraphQL API: Integrated GraphQL queries to ensure that every route was dynamically populated with the latest information, such as insurance plan details or treatment therapies. This enabled better content synchronization and accuracy across the website.

SEO Enhancements
- Unique, Descriptive URLs: Worked on SEO-friendly URL structure (e.g., /insurance/aetna/) to make each page more easily discoverable by search engines and users.
- Meta Tags & Structured Data: Added meta tags, OG tags, and structured data to ensure that each page had optimized content for search engines, social media platforms, and third-party applications.
- Content Management System Enhancements

Firestore Integration: Integrated Firestore as the backend database to store content for each category. This allowed real-time updates and easy content management without requiring heavy backend logic or manual updates, enabling non-technical administrators to manage content more efficiently.

PostgreSQL for Data Storage: Used PostgreSQL to store historical data and ensure consistency across dynamic routes, allowing for more sophisticated querying and content aggregation.

## User Experience Enhancements

UI/UX Design: Leveraged Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive, user-friendly interface, enhancing readability and mobile accessibility for healthcare-related content.

Navigation Optimization: Created intuitive breadcrumb navigation and category-based menus, allowing users to easily filter through insurance providers, treatment options, and other services.

Feedback Integration: Incorporated user feedback from both patients and site administrators to continually improve the flow of information and make the site easier to navigate.

Dynamic Routing and Page Generation
Built a scalable routing architecture using React Router + Gatsby to generate dynamic pages (e.g. /insurance/aetna/) that pulled structured data from GraphQL + Firestore.
Created templates for services, clinics, and FAQs that automatically generated new pages based on backend content updates—enabling content at scale with low engineering overhead.
Integrated PostgreSQL for structured historical data storage and advanced content filtering.

Structured Data & SEO Enhancements

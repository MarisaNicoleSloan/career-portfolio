# Blog Submenu and Category Pages

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project was to enhance user navigation on a content-rich blog with hundreds of posts. Our objective was to create a user-centric blog submenu and category pages, ensuring readers could effortlessly find and explore relevant content. Prior to this project, users faced challenges in locating and navigating through the extensive blog content.

## User Research Results:
We began by conducting user research, including surveys and usability testing. The findings revealed that users often felt overwhelmed by the volume of content and had difficulty finding articles of interest. This research served as a compelling justification for our enhancements.

# Custom Sitemap Index

## Problem Statement

The primary goal of this project was to improve the website's structure and organic visibility by implementing a custom sitemap index. This sitemap index would serve as a directory for multiple sitemaps, aiding search engines in understanding the website's hierarchy and improving the visibility of its pages. Prior to this project, our website faced challenges in efficiently communicating its structure to search engines and maximizing organic traffic.

## Technologies
- Gatsby
- GraphQL

## User Research Results

The project began with a comprehensive analysis of the website's organic visibility and search engine indexing. We identified opportunities to enhance our website's structure and provide search engines with a clearer understanding of the content hierarchy. User behavior analysis also revealed that users often struggled to navigate between different sections of the website effectively.

## Implementation

### Configured GraphQL Queries

I configured GraphQL queries to fetch content data, ensuring that the sitemap index accurately represented the website's structure. This step was crucial in providing search engines with the necessary information to crawl and index our site effectively.

### Utilized React Components

React components were employed to dynamically generate XML sitemaps. This approach made it easy to update and maintain the sitemap index as our website evolved. It also allowed us to ensure that every page, regardless of its depth within the website, was included in the sitemap index, maximizing SEO benefits.

## Results and Achievements
- Significantly improved the efficiency of search engine indexing, resulting in a 30% reduction in indexing time. This allowed new content to appear in search results more quickly
- 20% increase in the number of pages indexed within one week, boosting organic traffic and visibility
- The sitemap index facilitated cross-linking between related content, resulting in a 20% increase in user navigation between different sections of the website

### Dynamically Extracted Data

- I dynamically extracted data from a database and mapped it to the schema.org vocabulary to create structured data. This approach ensured that the information presented in search results was up-to-date and accurate.

### Enhanced Structured Data Types

- I enhanced various structured data types, including BreadcrumbList, MedicalBusiness, FAQPage, and MedicalClinic. These enhancements allowed us to provide richer and more informative data to search engines.

### Implementation of Structured Data

- I implemented structured data to provide search engines with rich information about medical businesses. This structured data included details about services offered, medical specialties, frequently asked questions, and clinic locations.

## Results and Achievements
- 20% increase in click-through rates to pages for medical treatment facilities, including a 10% increase in overall organic traffic
- Achieved significant improvement in search visibility by showcasing selected content as featured snippets in search results, establishing the website as a trusted medical information source
